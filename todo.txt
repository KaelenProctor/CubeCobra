Investigate
	- validate patreon integration

Eventually
fix proptypes - use object proptypes when possible
quickly switching cards between deck and sideboard during a sealed playtest, a few cards got duplicated
don't display mainboard header in changelist/changelog if only mainboard was changed
tag colors don't display in list view
don't update cube hashes for followers changes or deck count changes. have this be picked up by sweeper
drafts freezing is b/c they are getting stuck in "done" state by mistake, possible that we're not checking this in a consistent way?
capitalize board names in cube, including board drop down select
when adding through add to cube modal, put in pending changes instead of updating DB
Filter doesn't work on Tokens page
filtering on recommended cards does not seem to work anymore
filtercollapse should require a submit button again
look into failed deck migrations and get those moved over too


multiplayer drafting

fbd0f99f-7e82-4145-b8bc-82115f1c6224
	Got stuck, picks were piling up on seat 7 and bot picks were not being made
	after refresh, things were working normally and draft finished

- [x] new card pages 404
- [x] move to mainboard causes crash
- [x] bulk edit with some issues don't save
- [ ] reasonable cards in recommender
